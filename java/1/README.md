Question:
 Write a Java program to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers.
Test Data:
Input first number: 125
Input second number: 24
Expected Output :
125 + 24 = 149
125 - 24 = 101
125 x 24 = 3000
125 / 24 = 5
125 mod 24 = 5


NOTES:
void methods can't return something; methods with a return value have to return something; since methods state what value they return, we're quite limited in what we can return, i.e we can't return something like a plus sign (+) because that doesn't have a type (that I know of, at least :)
