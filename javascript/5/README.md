### Task
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Example
s = "abcdef"

Print abc def

Input Format
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contain a string, S.

Constraints
2 <= S <= 10000 

Output Format

For each String S, print S's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by S's odd-indexed characters.
