 QUESTION:
4. Write a Java program to print the result of the following operations. Go to the editor
        Test Data:
         a. -5 + 8 * 6
        b. (55+9) % 9
        c. 20 + -3*5 / 8
        d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3



NOTES: 
1.) We can't define methods inside other methods, unlike in languages like JS
2.) An int can be an expression (which results in an integer, of course); I tried to use a string at first but it wouldn't get evaluated.
