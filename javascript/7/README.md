### Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial

Function Description
Complete the factorial function in the editor below. Be sure to use recursion.

factorial has the following paramter:
int n: an integer

Returns
int: the factorial of n

Input Format
A single integer, n (the argument to pass to factorial).

Constraints
"2 <= n <= 12"

Sample Input
3

Sample Output
6

Explanation
factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2) = 3 * 2 = 6
factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1) = 2 * 1 = 2
factorial(1) = 1

Consider the following steps. After the recursive calls from step 1 to 3, results are accumulated from step 3 to 1.
